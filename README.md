# Commander

[Code Red Robotics](http://www.team639.org/)' 2010 robot "Commander" rewritten in rust.

This is actually the second time that Commander has been revitalized, the first being [in 2016 for testing purposes](https://github.com/CRRobotics/Robots/tree/master/CommanderNew). This time was just because a mentor suggested it might be useful to have another robot driveable and I was looking for an excuse to write a robot in rust and test out [first-rust-competition](https://github.com/Lytigas/first-rust-competition). At the moment it only has basic driving capabilities, but it was a good project to see how much potential rust has for use in FRC.

Commander is still using its original Victors, CIMs, and other drivetrain components, having recieved only a new PDP, VRM, RoboRio, and radio. Somehow, after 9 years in the corner of a closet, during which time the school flooded at least once and it was often scavenged for parts, it still ran without any technical difficulties on our first try.
